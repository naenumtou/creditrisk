## Application score (A-Score)
* `TitanicAppModel.ipynb`: Using Titanic dataset in the concept of application score.

## Behaviour score (B-Score)
* `factorsCreation.ipynb`: The initial stage of behaviour scoring model development is to create behaviour factors.
* `modifySampling.ipynb`: Shared idea for sampling construction, which integrated default experience condition.
* `SMOTESampling.ipynb`: The over sampling method using SMOTE to overcome imbalance target in the dataset.

## Model validation
* `scoringEvaluationMetrics.ipynb`: Scoring model evaluation metrics to measure scoring model peformance.
